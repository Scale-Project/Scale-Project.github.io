ProActive before SCALE</h2>            <p>ProActive (Proactive Parallel Suite) is a Java library (Source              code under AGPL license) for parallel, distributed, and concurrent              computing, also featuring mobility and security in a uniform              framework. With a reduced set of simple primitives, ProActive              provides a comprehensive API to simplify the programming of              applications that are distributed on a Local Area Network (LAN),              on cluster of workstations, Clouds, or on Internet Grids.</p>            <p>The library is based on an Active Object pattern that is a              uniform way to encapsulate:</p>            <ul>              <li>a remotely accessible object,</li>              <li>a thread,</li>              <li>a server of incoming requests,</li>              <li>a mobile and potentially secure agent.</li>            </ul>            <p>ProActive is only made of standard Java classes, and requires no              changes to the Java Virtual Machine, no preprocessing or compiler              modification; programmers write standard Java code. Based on a              simple Meta- Object Protocol, the library is itself extensible,              making the system open for adaptations and optimisations.              ProActive currently uses the RMI Java standard library as default              portable transport layer, but others such as ssh, Globus, or HTTP              can be used instead, in an adaptive way. ProActive supports for              JMX and OSGi capabilities, web service object exposition, an SCA              personality</p>            <div title="Page 10">              <div>                <div>                  <p>ProActive management, distribution, support, and                    commercialisation is now ensured by the start-up company                    ActiveEon (<a href="http://www.activeeon.com">http://www.activeeon.com</a>).                    A professionally maintained version of the ProActive library                    can be found <a href="http://proactive.activeeon.com/index.php">there</a>.</p>                </div>              </div>            </div>            <h2>2.

MAO reduce the number of deadlocks in                active objects and make them adapted to multicore architectures.<strong><strong></strong></strong><strong><strong></strong></strong><strong><strong></strong></strong>                Features supported:                <ul>                  <li>Annotation-based declaration of parallelizable services                    and local multi-threading.</li>                  <li>Thread limit declaration and annotation-based priority                    declaration.</li>                </ul>              </li>            </ul>            <p>A repository containing the research branch of the ProActive              middleware can be found <a href="https://github.com/scale-proactive/scale-proactive">there</a>.</p>            <p><br>            </p>          </div>        </div>      </div>    </div>    <p></p>    <hr>    <h1>VerCors:<strong> VERification of models for distributed communicating        COmponants, with safety and Security</strong></h1>    <div class="entry-content clearfix">      <h2>Presentation</h2>      <p>We are building a tool platform for the analysis and verification of        safety and security properties of distributed applications. The central        component of the platform is a method for generating finite models for        distributed applications, for a set of (model driven) graphical editors.<br>        We base the generation procedure on the strong semantic features        provided by the GCM component model, and we generate compositional        models using synchronised labelled transition systems. Various tools for        static analysis, model checking, and equivalence checking can then        operate on these models. One long term goal of this work is to integrate        the various techniques and tools involved in this software platform, so        that the platform can be integrated in a development environment, and        used by non-specialists.</p>      <h2 class="post-title entry-title"> VCEv4 Download </h2>      <div class="post-meta clearfix"> <span class="updated"> <span class="value-title"            title="2015-06-29T13:03">          </span> </span></div>      <div class="entry-content clearfix">        <h2>Vercors Component Environment Installation Guide: VCE-v4</h2>        <ol>          <li>Download and unzip <a href="http://www.obeodesigner.com/download">Obeo              Designer Community 8.x</a> .</li>          <li>Use <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/luna/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/tasks-124.htm">Eclipse              software installation manager</a> to install VCEv4 on Obeo            Designer from VCEv4 repository:            http://vercors.gforge.inria.fr/repository/.</li>        </ol>        <h2>VCE-v4 tutorial and examples</h2>        <p>The pdf version of the tutorial and examples can be found in our <a            href="https://github.com/Scale-VerCors/VCEv4">GitHub            repository</a>.</p>      </div>    </div>    <p></p>    <hr>    <h2>BtrPlace</h2>    <p> </p>    <div class="page" title="Page 19">      <div class="layoutArea">        <div class="column">          <p><span style="font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'SFRM1000'">Btrplace              is a software for the placement of virtual machines. BtrPlace is              available online under a LGPL licence (http ://www.btrplace.org)              and under the pro-              tection of the “Agence de Protection des Programmes”. It is              documented, heavily tested, and regularly re-              leased. These efforts started to pay as industrial companies              learned about BtrPlace and try it. Their feed-              backs first confirmed that flexibility matters. They also              initiated new research opportunities. Currently, Btr-              Place is downloaded around 1,000 times monthly from distinct IPs.              It is officially used by the startup Onyx              (http ://www.onyxplatform.org) to place peers doing data              processing. It is also in the starting block for being              used in production as a new scheduler for an international company              that is leading the worldwide market of              hyper-converged cloud platform.            </span></p>        </div>      </div>    </div>    <p>see at<a href="http://www.btrplace.org/"> http://www.btrplace.org/</a></p>    <p><br>    </p>    <p><br>    </p>    <p><br>    </p>  </body></html>
